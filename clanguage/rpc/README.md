# RPC Implementation in C

To implement RPC in C, we need three parts -

- server
- client
- protocol bw server and client

The easiest way to implement the protocol is by using `rpcgen` which is described [here](../rpcgen).

Further explanations are given [here](https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/C/node34.html).
