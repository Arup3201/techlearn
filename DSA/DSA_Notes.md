# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and algorithms are one of the most important topics in computer science where you learn to solve problems with optimized algorithms that take as little time as possible. It is the study to making algorithms and thinking of optimized solutions that takes less memory and less time.

This note will covers the following topics-

1. Mathematics
2. Bit Manipulation
3. Recursion
4. Arrays
5. Searching
6. Sorting
7. Matrix
8. Hashing
9. Strings
10. LinkedList
11. Stack
12. Queue
13. Deque
14. Tree
15. Binary Search Tree
16. Heap
17. Graph
18. Greedy
19. Backtracking
20. Dynamic Programming
21. Trie
22. Segment and Binary Indexed Tree
23. Disjoint Set

## Sorting

In this section, I will discuss about the sorting techniques. Each technique is used in certain situations and gives good result when used. Some of them has higher time complexity some of them has lower.

But, there are 2 factors that you will hear frequently when going through the sorting algorithms - Inplace, Stable.

- Inplace - sorting is performed on the original array or new sorted array is returned.
- Stable - Same values are ordered in the exact previous order or not.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a stable sort and an inplace algorithm that changes the original array without returning any sorted array.

The best way to describe this algorithm is by card shifting. When you have cards in your hand and you have some way to know which comes before the other one. You go through the cards from left to right. When you encounter a card that is smaller than the previous card, you start shifting the bigger cards to the right of this smaller card untill you find a card that is same or less than the smaller card on it's left side.
